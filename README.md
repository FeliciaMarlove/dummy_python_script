# dummy_python_script
Dummy Python script that reads information in a SQL database, generates a semi-random object and makes a http-post request.
This script was part of a school project. Its goal was to simulate fuel fillups based on an existing database of car owners, generate random data with a high chance to create a record with discrepancies and make a http request to an API.
It allowed to test my application without having total control over data, and without having to type N requests body myself.
